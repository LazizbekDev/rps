### Conclusion

I hope you enjoy playing this game! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.

### Code Explanation

The code for the game is divided into several files. The main file, `main.py`, contains the main game loop. This loop controls the flow of the game and handles all of the user input.

The other files contain the code for the different rooms, enemies, and items in the game. These files are responsible for rendering the graphics, handling the physics, and implementing the game logic.

I have tried to make the code as clear and easy to understand as possible. However, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
